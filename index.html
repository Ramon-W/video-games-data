      <h1>About:</h1>
      <pre>This webapp contains video game data from <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/video_games/">The CORGIS Data Set Project</a>, containing 
        1212 titles from the year 2004 to 2009. It includes the general information about each game like publisher, sales, and review scores.
        
        One set of statistics for each video game is the playtime, crowdsourced from <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com">HowLongToBeat.com</a>. This includes average 
        time of all playstyles, as well as individual playstyles. If a playstyle for a game does not exist (e.g. completionists), then it is denoted as 0 hours. 
        Additionally, if the game does not have a specific end or there is no sufficient data, every time would be marked as 0 hours. 
        
        Publisher may be left blank if the publisher of the video game is unknown. Ratings are from <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/gameratings">ESRB</a>,
        but only includes E, T, and M. The review score is out of 100, and from <a href="https://www.metacritic.com">Metacritic</a>.
